# GHGI Sectors and Subsectors Reference

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the sectors and subsectors used in greenhouse gas inventories (GHGI) according to the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories (GPC).

## Overview

The GPC framework enables cities to consistently measure and report their greenhouse gas emissions. Each sector and subsector is associated with specific emission scopes to provide detailed insights for climate action planning.
