The data series used in the study was elaborated from records of daily maximum precipitations per hydrological year from the Valença pluviometric station, code 01339038 (ANA), located 14km from the municipality of Cairu. The methodology for defining the equation by disaggregation of daily precipitations is described in detail in Pinto (2013). The frequency distribution adjusted to the daily data was Gumbel, with parameters calculated by the L-moments method. The disaggregation of daily quantiles into other durations was performed with the relationships between rainfall heights of different durations obtained from the IDF equation established by Otto Pfafstetter for the municipality of Salvador/BA (Pfafstetter, 1982). The adjusted equations to represent the family of IDF curves can be applied for durations between 5min and 24h and are recommended for return periods up to 100 years. The application of the IDF equation elaborated for the municipality of Cairu allows associating precipitation intensities, in different durations, with occurrence frequencies, which will be used in the dimensioning of hydraulic structures. It can also be used inversely, that is, to estimate the frequency of a precipitation event that occurred in a given duration, defining whether the event was rare or ordinary, according to the characterization of local extreme rain.

Several entries offer Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves, which are crucial for flood hazard assessment. There are also datasets related to storm surge projections, extreme rainfall analysis, and real-time pluviometric data. Credible sources like scientific journals, government agencies (CPRM, ANA, Cemaden), and international organizations (World Bank) are well-represented. While some entries are research papers that don't directly provide downloadable datasets, they indicate the existence of underlying data or methodologies that could be pursued. The CLIMBra dataset is particularly valuable as it offers bias-corrected CMIP6 projections for various climate variables, including precipitation, at a fine spatial resolution. The CABra dataset provides extensive catchment attributes, which are highly relevant for hydrological modeling and flood risk assessment. The main limitation is the lack of direct links to downloadable geospatial data for all entries, with some being research papers or interactive maps without explicit download options for the raw data.",

CLIMBra offers national-level gridded precipitation data for historical and future scenarios, which is highly valuable.

Storm surge projections for the Southeast Brazilian Coast are also relevant. However, some entries are research papers discussing frameworks or specific events without direct access to comprehensive datasets, or are too general (e.g., 'Analysis of Extreme Rainfall and Natural Disasters Events'). The World Bank's 'Observed Climatology' is useful for historical context but primarily focuses on temperature, with precipitation as a secondary variable, and its format (images) might limit direct analytical use. The granularity of some datasets is regional or municipal, which is good, but a comprehensive national-level flood hazard dataset with consistent methodology is still needed.",
