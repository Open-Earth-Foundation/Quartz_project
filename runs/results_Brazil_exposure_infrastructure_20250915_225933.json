The IBGE links provide crucial administrative boundaries and sanitation infrastructure data. Several links were empty or less relevant.",

These documents explicitly mention downloadable vector/raster formats and interactive maps with detailed layers."

            "summary": "The extracted structured data provides a strong foundation for a CCRA exposure assessment in Brazil, particularly for infrastructure. Several datasets from credible sources like IBGE, ANEEL, EPE, and MapBiomas offer detailed geospatial information on transportation, energy, and sanitation infrastructure, as well as built-up areas and demographic characteristics. While some entries are less directly relevant (e.g., land cover fractions without explicit infrastructure links, or general demographic publications without spatial data), the core infrastructure datasets are highly valuable. The availability of municipal-level data and continuous updates from official sources enhances the potential for a robust assessment. There are some gaps in specific critical infrastructure categories (e.g., hospitals, schools explicitly) and detailed economic/financial indicators directly linked to infrastructure assets, but the existing data can serve as a strong base.",
            "reasoning": "The extracted data provides a comprehensive and credible set of exposure infrastructure datasets for Brazil, covering key sectors like energy, transportation, and sanitation, along with essential demographic and built-environment information. The sources are highly authoritative, and the spatial and temporal resolutions are generally suitable for CCRA. While some specific critical infrastructure types and detailed economic indicators could be further explored, the current collection is robust enough to proceed with analysis.",
