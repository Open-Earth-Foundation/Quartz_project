Exposure was analyzed for irrigated and non-irrigated crops, and vulnerability was assessed through a socioecological-system (SES) perspective, using socioecological susceptibility and lack of coping-capacity indicators weighted by drought experts. The analysis shows heterogeneous drought risk patterns globally, with higher risk in southeastern Europe, northern, and southern Africa. The study aims to support the identification of tailored measures to reduce drought risk and increase the resilience of agricultural systems.",
