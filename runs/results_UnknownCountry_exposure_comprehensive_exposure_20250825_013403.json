There are also datasets covering land use/land cover, critical facilities (though primarily US coastal), and subnational poverty. While some datasets are general (e.g., OpenStreetMap general info, research papers), the core exposure indicators are well-represented by specific, actionable datasets. The temporal coverage is generally good, with many datasets offering multi-year or projected data.",

The identified datasets are sufficient to proceed with the next phase of the CCRA.",
