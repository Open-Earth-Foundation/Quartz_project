Key sources include reputable organizations like NASA, ESA, IFPRI, FAO, and academic publishers (Nature, MDPI, ScienceDirect). While there's good coverage of agricultural land, specific exposure indicators related to population, built environment, economic, socioeconomic vulnerability, health, and governance are largely missing, as expected for an 'agriculture' specific exposure search. The current search plan was for 'Global cropland extent', 'ESA WorldCover', and 'Global Food Security-support Analysis Data (GFSAD)', and the extracted data aligns well with these queries, providing relevant datasets for agricultural exposure.",
            "reasoning": "The extracted datasets are highly relevant, credible, and provide excellent coverage for the 'agriculture' component of exposure at a global scale and fine resolution. They directly address the initial search queries and provide valuable geospatial data for CCRA. While other exposure categories are not covered, this is consistent with the specific 'agriculture' focus of the search. These datasets are ready for use in quantitative risk assessment.",
