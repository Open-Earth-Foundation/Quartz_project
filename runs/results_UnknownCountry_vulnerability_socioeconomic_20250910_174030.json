The World Bank DataBank and Open Data portals are excellent starting points for global socioeconomic indicators. The University of Iowa dataset on subnational Gini coefficients is particularly valuable due to its geospatial format and fine resolution. Documents with 'No content available' or general news/blog content are not useful for direct data extraction.",

These are directly relevant to the CCRA context of socioeconomic vulnerability."

Several datasets from reputable sources like the World Bank, NASA SEDAC, and WorldPop offer high-resolution gridded data for income inequality, poverty, and population distribution. While some entries are US-specific or more general, the global datasets are highly relevant and meet the spatial resolution requirements for gridded data. The temporal coverage is generally good, spanning recent years and offering historical data for trend analysis.",
            "reasoning": "The majority of the extracted datasets are highly relevant, credible, and sufficiently complete for a global socioeconomic vulnerability assessment. They provide gridded data at appropriate resolutions (1km or finer for several key indicators) and cover the required CCRA mode and type. The data formats are suitable for geospatial analysis. Therefore, these datasets can be directly utilized for the CCRA.",
