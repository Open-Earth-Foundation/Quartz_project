The UNFCCC GHG Data Interface page is an authoritative gateway to official national inventory submissions and multiple query tools. Both documents represent primary sources for structured GHGI data with strong institutional backing.",

PRIMAP-hist provides a consolidated historical dataset with subsector resolution for IPPU, while the UNFCCC interface offers direct access to official country-reported CRF data. These are ideal starting points for extracting structured EU IPPU emissions data. Extraction should focus on identifying download links, data access methods, and specific IPPU category breakdowns."
