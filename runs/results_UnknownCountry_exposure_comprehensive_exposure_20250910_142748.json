The expansion accelerated, with half of the new cropland replacing natural vegetation and tree cover.

            "summary": "The extracted structured data provides a strong foundation for a comprehensive exposure assessment at a global scale. Several datasets directly address key exposure indicators, including population distribution (GPWv411, WorldPop, LandScan Global), built-up areas (GHS-BUILT-S, GHSL Data Package), critical infrastructure (Harmonized Global Critical infrastructure & Index, gROADSv1), and land cover/land use (Sentinel-2, Copernicus Global Land Cover, WorldCover, Global maps of cropland extent). The spatial resolutions are generally good, with many datasets offering 1km or finer resolution, which is crucial for detailed CCRA. The temporal coverage is also adequate, with some datasets providing historical time series and future projections. While some entries are more descriptive (e.g., GHS-DEGURBA Toolkit, Integrated Geospatial Infrastructure) and point to tools or frameworks rather than direct data, they indicate valuable resources for processing and integrating exposure data. The inclusion of a dataset on gridded GDP and electricity consumption is also highly relevant for economic exposure.",
            "reasoning": "The extracted structured data is highly relevant, credible, and sufficiently complete for initiating a comprehensive exposure assessment at a global scale. The datasets meet the specified criteria for spatial resolution (many at 1km or finer), temporal coverage, and data format (geospatial). There are multiple strong candidates for each key exposure indicator, providing robust options for the CCRA. No significant gaps or issues were identified that would warrant a 'deep_dive' or 'reject' action at this stage.",
