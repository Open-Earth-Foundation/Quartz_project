It also employs a logit model to estimate impacts of household characteristics on poverty. The health and sanitation dimension contributed most to the MPI, followed by education and housing conditions. Unidimensional poverty was higher than multidimensional poverty, and poverty in rural areas was also higher. Determinants of poverty include non-white, younger, unmarried, unemployed, less educated household heads, and being from the North and Northeast regions. Female-headed households had lower chances of multidimensional poverty but higher chances of unidimensional poverty.",

Several sources offer municipal-level data, Gini coefficients, population demographics, and some insights into income inequality and poverty. The IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) is a recurring and highly credible source. However, direct access to raw, spatially-enabled datasets (GIS files, shapefiles) for some of the mentioned data requires further investigation or specific access methods beyond simple web queries. While some articles discuss flood impacts and temperature exposure, the raw data for these specific hazard-vulnerability intersections is not directly available in a usable format.",

However, the 'method_of_access' often indicates 'web interface query' or 'downloadable PDF' rather than direct links to GIS files or structured databases that are readily usable for spatial analysis. A 'deep_dive' is needed to navigate these official websites (especially IBGE's SIDRA and Censo Demográfico portals) to locate and attempt to download the actual geospatial datasets (shapefiles, geodatabases, or gridded data) for income distribution, poverty rates, and Gini coefficients at municipal or finer administrative levels.

Look for data that can be linked to administrative boundaries. \n2. For 'Esri Standard Demographics Dataset for Brazil': Investigate how to access the actual spatial data (e.g., through ArcGIS Online, Esri's data browser, or specific data licensing information) to obtain the mentioned demographic variables at the finest available spatial resolution (Statistical Areas Level 1 or 2).\n3. For 'Flood impact on income inequality in the Itapocu River basin, Brazil' and 'Inequality and income segregation in Brazilian cities: a nationwide analysis': While the articles are informative, the raw data (census data, flood maps, income segregation indices) would need to be specifically requested from authors or relevant institutions if deemed critical for the assessment.
