The spatial and temporal resolutions are generally good, with many datasets offering daily or hourly data at resolutions suitable for global to regional analysis (e.g., 0.1° to 0.25°). There are also future projections available, which are crucial for CCRA. However, some entries are purely descriptive articles without direct data access, or focus on specific regions (e.g., Italy, Serbia, Ethiopia, China, Peru, Java, Finland, India) which, while useful for methodology, are not directly 'Global' datasets for direct use.

Many sources are highly credible (e.g., Copernicus, NOAA, NASA, ECMWF, Nature, ScienceDirect). The spatial and temporal resolutions vary, with several datasets offering high-resolution gridded data (e.g., 0.1° to 0.25° resolution, daily/hourly temporal coverage) suitable for heatwave analysis. There are numerous datasets directly providing temperature data (maximum, minimum, mean), temperature anomalies, and derived heat stress metrics (e.g., UTCI, apparent temperature, heatwave duration/frequency/intensity). While some entries are research articles discussing datasets rather than direct data portals, they often point to the underlying data sources (e.g., ERA5, CMIP6). The 'Global' target location is well-covered. The primary limitation is the lack of specific 'exposure' indicators within these hazard-focused extractions, as the current search plan was explicitly for 'hazards heatwave'. However, for the 'hazards' component of CCRA, this collection is robust.",
