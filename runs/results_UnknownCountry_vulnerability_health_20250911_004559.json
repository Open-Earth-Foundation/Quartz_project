While some entries are articles rather than direct data sources, they often point to underlying datasets or methodologies that are highly relevant.

These provide crucial demographic and population data at fine spatial resolutions, which are essential for comprehensive exposure analysis in CCRA. Other sources offer valuable insights into specific health vulnerabilities (diabetes, chronic diseases, malnutrition) and population aging, though some are at coarser resolutions or are more descriptive than quantitative spatial data. The World Health Organization (WHO) and International Diabetes Federation (IDF) sources are highly credible for health statistics. The primary limitation is the lack of direct, easily downloadable geospatial files for all relevant datasets, necessitating further investigation for some.",
            "reasoning": "Several highly relevant and credible sources have been identified, particularly WorldPop and the Nature gridded population dataset, which offer global, high-resolution demographic data crucial for health vulnerability. However, the 'method_of_access' for some of these, especially the gridded population datasets, indicates 'Downloadable PDF mentioned, implying data might be available via the publisher or supplementary materials' or 'API, downloadable files via data catalog'. A 'deep_dive' is necessary to directly access and confirm the availability of the actual geospatial data files (e.g., GeoTIFFs, shapefiles) at the specified resolutions (1km or finer) and to explore the full extent of data available through WorldPop's API/data catalog. Additionally, while health conditions are mentioned, direct spatial datasets for these conditions at a global or sub-national level (beyond specific country examples like Kenya or Ethiopia) need to be confirmed for direct use in a GIS.",

Several datasets offer global or country-level population data with age structures, which directly addresses the initial search queries. Crucially, WorldPop stands out as a highly relevant source for gridded population data, including age and sex structures, at high spatial resolutions, which is critical for spatial analysis in CCRA. Other sources provide valuable health statistics (diabetes prevalence, mortality rates, chronic diseases, access to healthcare) at various granularities, from global to subnational. While some entries are articles rather than direct data sources, they often point to underlying datasets or methodologies that are highly relevant. The primary limitation is the lack of explicit disability rates with spatial resolution, which was part of the initial search plan. However, the breadth of other health vulnerability indicators and the availability of high-resolution population data make this collection highly valuable.",
            "reasoning": "The extracted data provides a robust and comprehensive set of resources for assessing health vulnerability at a global scale, with many datasets offering subnational or gridded spatial resolution. Key requirements for population age distribution and health indicators are met by highly credible sources. The availability of gridded population data (e.g., WorldPop, Nature article on 1km resolution data) is particularly valuable for spatial analysis, meeting the resolution requirement of 5km or finer. While explicit 'disability rates GIS' were not found, the overall collection is sufficient to build a strong health vulnerability assessment. Further searching for this specific indicator can be a subsequent, targeted effort if deemed absolutely critical after initial analysis of the available data.",
