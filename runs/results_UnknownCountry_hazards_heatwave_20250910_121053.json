It compares canopy-layer air temperatures measured at 274 urban microsites during the summers of 2019 and 2020 with official weather station data. The study reveals that microsites recorded significantly more days of extreme heat than official stations, leading to novel 'heat risk' maps for local government areas. It highlights the underreporting of heat and its implications for preparedness in urban populations.",

The system provides insights into heat health risks, enabling decision-makers to take informed actions and protect vulnerable communities by classifying areas based on heat stress levels (No thermal stress, Moderate, Strong, Very strong, Extreme heat stress) and estimating population exposure.

            "description": "This study revealed an approximate doubling in both the frequency and the magnitude of regional heat wave events observed over 1960–2018 in China. The identified top three regional heat wave events occurred in the summers of 2013, 2017, and 2003, respectively. Fine-resolution multimodel climate projections suggest that China will experience regional heat wave events with magnitude exceeding the 2013 heat event on a regular basis by 2030 under a business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5). Compared to a 2 °C warming level, 1.5 °C warming could halve the expected occurrence of future severe regional heat wave events with magnitude similar to or slightly greater than the record-breaking one in 2013.",
