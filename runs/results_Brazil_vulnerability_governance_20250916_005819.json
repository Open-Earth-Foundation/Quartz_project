It aims to provide statistical data and vulnerability indicators to support risk management strategies and public policies. The AIOs are a territorial mesh for activating specific census questionnaire items. The study identified 12,726 AIOs covering 620.9 km² (approx. 1.2% of urban areas in Brazil), with a large majority in areas vulnerable to hydrological processes (263.51km²) and mass gravitational movements (113.75km²). It identified 1,546,176 geocoded address records from the National Register of Addresses for Statistical Purposes (CNEFE), with 84% being private households, corresponding to 1.4% of all households surveyed in Brazil in 2022. The data is intended to inform social and economic actions for regional public policies.",

This information is invaluable for guiding subsequent data acquisition efforts. The relevance and credibility are high, and the completeness is sufficient to confirm the existence and characteristics of highly relevant data for vulnerability governance. The identified datasets (AIOs, CNEFE) cover multiple exposure indicators (demographic, socioeconomic, built environment implicitly) at a fine spatial resolution (national, municipal, 620.9 km² total area for AIOs, geocoded addresses).
