The RII registry offers industrial facility-level data that can support IPPU sector analysis. All sources are from official government bodies or international frameworks.

However, the original search plan specifically targeted non-energy IPPU emissions (lubricants, paraffin waxes, fluorinated gases), and the extracted data descriptions do not explicitly confirm coverage of these specific product categories. A deep dive is warranted to: (1) Verify that MITECO's inventory includes detailed IPPU non-energy product breakdowns; (2) Confirm whether the UNFCCC interface provides subsectoral detail for chemical products; (3) Determine if RII contains facility-level data for relevant IPPU industries.
