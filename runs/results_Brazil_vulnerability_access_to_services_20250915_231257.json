It uses data on ICU and hospital beds, general or intensivist physicians, nurses, nursing technicians, physiotherapists, and ventilators from each health region in Brazil. A health service accessibility index was created using a two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) and spatial analysis was performed to identify areas lacking access to high-complexity centers (HCC). The study highlights uneven distribution of health facilities, equipment, and human resources across the country, particularly noting lower accessibility in the northern region.",
