It integrates information on economic, energy, and agricultural development, emission control potentials and costs, atmospheric dispersion, and environmental sensitivities. The model assesses impacts on human health from fine particulates and ground-level ozone, ecosystem damage from acidification and eutrophication, and climate metrics including warming potential. It quantifies emissions of CO2, CH4, N2O, fluorinated gases (HFCs, PFCs, SF6), SO2, NOx, NH3, VOCs, PM2.5, PM10, black carbon, organic carbon, and mercury. The model has global coverage representing 180 countries/regions and spans 1990 to 2050 in five-year intervals with extension to 2070 for the European region. It contains over 1,000 emission source sectors with associated emission factors and reduction technologies.",

The sources include both aggregate EU-level data and national-level breakdowns for all EU27 member states. Data appears current (2024-2025 updates noted) and methodologically sound. However, the extraction focuses on data portals and tools rather than specific quantitative emission values or detailed activity data tables. The sources are well-positioned to contain the needed GHGI data, but direct access to specific datasets and their detailed contents requires verification.",
            "reasoning": "The extracted structured data identifies official, credible, and comprehensive GHGI sources for the European Union that meet all acceptance criteria: (1) Official national/EU-level GHGI activity data from government statistical offices (EEA, Eurostat); (2) Strong indication these websites contain desired data - they are explicitly designed as GHGI data repositories; (3) Coverage of key emission categories across all sectors; (4) Data is current and methodologically sound. The sources are well-established reference points for EU GHGI research. While deeper investigation of specific datasets may be needed for detailed analysis, the foundational data infrastructure is confirmed and credible. No gaps in sector coverage or source credibility warrant rejection or extended deep-dive investigation at this stage. The search plan has successfully identified the primary EU GHGI data sources.",
