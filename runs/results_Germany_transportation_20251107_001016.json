Primary limitation is that some datasets require deeper exploration of sub-pages to access specific tables/files, but this is typical for government statistical portals.",
            "reasoning": "While the sources are highly credible and clearly relevant, a deep_dive is warranted rather than immediate acceptance because: (1) The extraction describes portal/gateway pages rather than direct access to specific datasets - KBA and Destatis URLs appear to be navigation hubs requiring sub-page exploration; (2) Specific data tables on fuel sales by type, vehicle-kilometres by category, and electricity consumption for road transport are mentioned in descriptions but not confirmed as directly accessible from the provided URLs; (3) UBA's 'Emissionen des Verkehrs' mentions downloadable Excel files but these are not directly linked; (4) The search plan queries specifically target fuel sales, vehicle kilometres, and electricity consumption data - these need confirmation of availability and format from the actual data pages.
