The study identified associations between minimum temperature and hospitalizations, with an increase in minimum temperature by 4°C reflecting an 18% elevation in the risk of hospitalizations, attributing 15.2% of hospitalizations to this increase and an excess of approximately US$68,000.00 in healthcare system costs during the evaluated period.",

Some entries point to general climate data portals (e.g., Earth Engine, World Bank Climate Knowledge Portal) which might contain relevant data but require further investigation to pinpoint specific heatwave-related datasets at the required resolution. Crucially, there are several highly relevant datasets identified, such as 'High-resolution monthly precipitation and temperature time series from 2006 to 2100' (5km resolution), 'CLIMBra - Climate Change Dataset for Brazil' (0.25x0.25 degree), and 'Global hourly, 5 km, all-sky land surface temperature data from 2011 to 2021'. These datasets offer the spatial and temporal resolution needed for heatwave hazard assessment. Additionally, INMET and IDR-Paraná provide historical and current temperature data, though their direct usability for heatwave indices across Brazil needs to be confirmed. The main challenge is that many entries are research papers or general catalogs, not direct data sources, and some are focused on other countries or very localized areas without broader applicability.",

While some direct data sources are identified (e.g., CLIMBra, GHA-LST), further effort would be needed to consolidate and access all potentially relevant raw data from the mentioned portals and research papers.

            "summary": "The extracted structured data contains a mix of relevant and less relevant information for heatwave hazards in Brazil. Several entries are academic articles discussing heatwaves, their trends, and impacts, which are valuable for context and methodology but do not directly provide raw, usable datasets for a quantitative CCRA. Some entries point to general climate data portals (e.g., Earth Engine, World Bank Climate Knowledge Portal) which might contain relevant data but require further investigation to pinpoint specific heatwave-related datasets at the required resolution. Crucially, there are several highly relevant datasets identified, such as 'High-resolution monthly precipitation and temperature time series from 2006 to 2100' (5km resolution), 'CLIMBra - Climate Change Dataset for Brazil' (0.25x0.25 degree), and 'Global hourly, 5 km, all-sky land surface temperature data from 2011 to 2021'. These datasets offer the spatial and temporal resolution needed for heatwave hazard assessment. Additionally, INMET and IDR-Paraná provide historical and current temperature data, though their direct usability for heatwave indices across Brazil needs to be confirmed. The main challenge is that many entries are research papers or general catalogs, not direct data sources, and some are focused on other countries or very localized areas without broader applicability.",
            "reasoning": "Despite some entries being academic papers rather than direct data sources, the review successfully identified several highly relevant, credible, and high-resolution datasets for heatwave hazards in Brazil (e.g., 'High-resolution monthly precipitation and temperature time series from 2006 to 2100', 'CLIMBra', 'GHA-LST'). These datasets meet the spatial resolution requirement (5km or finer) and cover appropriate temporal ranges for CCRA. The identified sources are authoritative and provide a strong basis for proceeding with data acquisition and analysis for heatwave hazards in Brazil. Further steps would involve actively downloading and processing these identified datasets.",
