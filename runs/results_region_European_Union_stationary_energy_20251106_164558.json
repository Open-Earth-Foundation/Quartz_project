ETXtra aggregates multiple official sources including EU ETS data and EEA reports. All sources are from recognized EU institutions (EEA, European Commission, ODYSSEE-MURE project).

The extracted data includes both energy efficiency indicators and comprehensive greenhouse gas inventory data covering multiple sectors (stationary energy, transportation, waste, IPPU, AFOLU). All sources are official EU portals with national-level granularity appropriate for GHGI purposes. The EEA greenhouse gases data viewer is particularly significant as it directly addresses EU Member State GHG reporting under the EU Governance Regulation. Data appears current (last updated April-May 2025 and October 2025). The main limitation is that the extraction provides source descriptions rather than actual emission values or detailed methodological documentation, but this is expected at the discovery phase.",

The EEA greenhouse gases data viewer is the primary official source for EU GHG inventory reporting under EU Governance Regulation. ODYSSEE MURE provides complementary energy consumption and efficiency data essential for stationary energy sector analysis. All sources offer national-level data for EU Member States, which is appropriate and sufficient for GHGI purposes. The sources are current, accessible via web interfaces, and explicitly designed for GHG and energy monitoring. No critical gaps have been identified that would require additional searching. The next phase should proceed to data extraction from these identified sources rather than conducting additional searches.",
