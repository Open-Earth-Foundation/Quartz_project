            "summary": "The extracted data provides a good range of global flood hazard datasets, including historical precipitation, river discharge, sub-daily precipitation indices, and high-resolution flood hazard models. Several sources are from reputable institutions like NOAA, Copernicus, JRC, and academic publishers. The spatial and temporal coverages are generally appropriate for global flood hazard assessment, with resolutions ranging from point measurements to 90m and 250m gridded data. The data formats are suitable for analysis (NetCDF, GRIB2, GeoTIFF). While some entries are research articles describing models rather than direct data portals, they indicate the existence of such data. The World Bank entries are less directly relevant to flood *hazards* but could contain related socioeconomic data for vulnerability/exposure.",
            "reasoning": "The extracted structured data provides a robust collection of global flood hazard datasets from highly credible sources, with appropriate spatial and temporal coverage and suitable data formats for CCRA. The completeness of hazard indicators is high, making it suitable for quantitative risk assessment. While some entries are research articles, they point to the existence and methodology of relevant data products. The collection is sufficient to proceed with the hazard component of the CCRA.",
