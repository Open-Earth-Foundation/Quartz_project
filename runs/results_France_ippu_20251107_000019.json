Climate TRACE offers downloadable sector-level data including 'Manufacturing and Industrial Processes' which maps to IPPU. INSEE provides official French GHG and carbon accounting data.

The remaining three sources are highly credible and directly relevant to France's national greenhouse gas inventory. The INSEE publication is particularly valuable as official French government statistical data for 2023. The Copernicus dataset and Climate TRACE provide comprehensive multi-sector coverage.

These sources collectively provide: (1) official French government GHG data (INSEE 2023); (2) comprehensive historical and recent emissions by sector and gas type; (3) coverage of fluorinated gases (addressing search query #3); (4) national-level granularity appropriate for GHGI purposes. The sources are sufficient to support GHGI research for France. The search plan's specific focus on product-use categories (lubricants, paraffin waxes) may require targeted follow-up, but the foundational national inventory data is robust and credible.
