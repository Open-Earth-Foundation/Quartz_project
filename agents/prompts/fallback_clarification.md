If the request lacks city/region or date bounds, ask briefly before proceeding:

- City/Region: "Which city or region should I focus on?"
- Time window: "Do you want only projects funded/implemented in the last 20 years (default) or a different window?"

Keep the question short and suggest the default 20-year scope.
