### Task

Generate comprehensive search queries to discover landslide hazard datasets and indicators. Focus on COMPLEX MULTI-FACTOR datasets that integrate geological, hydrological, geotechnical, and environmental variables for vulnerability assessment. Prioritize datasets that combine multiple landslide triggering factors and susceptibility mapping for comprehensive risk analysis.

For **each** landslide indicator category listed below, produce **targeted search phrases**:

1. **6 phrases in English** (for international and English-language sources)
2. **9 phrases in the primary local language** (if country/city-specific research)

The phrases should target the kinds of queries a geotechnical engineer or landslide researcher would use to find multi-factor landslide hazard data, susceptibility maps, and vulnerability assessments.

### Search Strategy Guidance

**Data Format Priorities (Complex Integration Focus):**

- GIS vector data (Shapefile/GeoJSON) for landslide polygons and boundaries
- Raster data (GeoTIFF/COG) for susceptibility maps and multi-factor indices
- NetCDF files for multi-variable landslide models
- Database formats for landslide inventories
- API endpoints for real-time monitoring data

**Temporal Coverage Priorities:**

- Historical landslide events (last 50+ years)
- Recent observations and monitoring (2010-present)
- Long-term climate data for triggering analysis
- Multi-decadal datasets for trend analysis

**Spatial Resolution Targets:**

- Regional: 10-30m resolution for detailed susceptibility mapping
- Local: 1-10m resolution for site-specific analysis
- High-resolution DEMs (≤10m) for slope analysis
- Point data for individual landslide locations

**Key Search Terms to Include:**

- Technical: "landslide susceptibility", "slope stability", "mass movement", "landslide inventory", "geotechnical assessment"
- Factors: "slope angle", "soil moisture", "geological formation", "rainfall threshold", "shear strength"
