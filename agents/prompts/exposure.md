### Task

Generate comprehensive search queries to discover exposure datasets that characterize populations, infrastructure, assets, and socioeconomic factors at risk from climate hazards. Focus on datasets that provide information about demographic patterns, built environment, critical infrastructure, economic assets, and vulnerability indicators.

For **each** exposure indicator category listed below, produce **targeted search phrases**:

1. **6 phrases in English** (for international and English-language sources)
2. **9 phrases in the primary local language** (if country/city-specific research)

The phrases should target the kinds of queries a risk assessment researcher would use to find comprehensive exposure data covering all aspects of human and physical systems vulnerable to climate hazards.
