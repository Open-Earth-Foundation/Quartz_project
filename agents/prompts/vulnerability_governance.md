### Task

Generate comprehensive search queries to discover governance vulnerability datasets that characterize institutional capacity for climate adaptation and response. Focus on datasets that provide information about disaster preparedness, early warning systems, climate adaptation planning, emergency shelter capacity, and institutional coordination mechanisms that influence climate vulnerability.

Strict geospatial and resolution constraints:

- Only include geospatial datasets (vector/raster) suitable for GIS; avoid narrative-only policy PDFs unless they link to spatial datasets
- Require spatial resolution 5 km or finer (≤5 km) for any gridded layers; vector data should be at administrative/neighborhood or finer scales
- Exclude non-geospatial sources and datasets coarser than 5 km unless they directly link to qualifying spatial data

For **each** governance vulnerability category listed below, produce **targeted search phrases**:

1. **6 phrases in English** (for international and English-language sources)
2. **9 phrases in the primary local language** (if country/city-specific research)

The phrases should target the kinds of queries a governance vulnerability researcher would use to find disaster management data, institutional capacity assessments, policy documents, emergency response planning, and adaptive governance information relevant to climate risk assessment.

### Search Strategy Guidance

**Data Format Priorities:**

- Spatial vectors: Shapefile/GeoJSON for administrative boundaries, service coverage, shelter locations
- Spatial rasters: GeoTIFF/COG for gridded governance-related indices or coverage surfaces
- Geocoded databases/APIs: Feature services with coordinates or joinable admin codes
- Tabular indicators: CSV/Excel only when joinable to geometry (coordinates/admin codes)

**Spatial Resolution Targets:**

- Administrative units: National, regional, and local government boundaries
- Institutional scale: Ministry, agency, and departmental jurisdictions
- Community level: Neighborhood and local governance structures
- Multi-scale: Cross-jurisdictional coordination and planning

**Temporal Coverage Priorities:**

- Current planning: Most recent adaptation and disaster plans
- Policy evolution: Time series of policy development and implementation
- Assessment cycles: Regular capacity and preparedness evaluations
- Implementation tracking: Progress monitoring and evaluation data

**Key Search Terms to Include:**

- Governance: "institutional capacity", "adaptive governance", "policy implementation"
- Disaster management: "disaster preparedness", "emergency response", "risk reduction"
- Climate adaptation: "adaptation planning", "climate resilience", "mitigation strategies"
- Coordination: "inter-agency coordination", "stakeholder engagement", "multi-level governance"

**Repository-Specific Searches:**

- Target national disaster management and emergency agencies
- Search UNDRR and international disaster risk reduction databases
- Look for academic governance and policy studies repositories
- Include government planning and development ministry databases
- Search for NGO disaster preparedness and governance assessment data

### Vulnerability Orientation Guidelines

**Higher Values = Greater Vulnerability:**

- Lower institutional capacity and coordination
- Limited disaster preparedness and planning
- Weak early warning system coverage
- Insufficient emergency shelter capacity
- Poor policy implementation and monitoring

**Lower Values = Greater Vulnerability (Invert for Analysis):**

- Institutional capacity and coordination strength
- Disaster preparedness and response effectiveness
- Early warning system coverage and effectiveness
- Emergency shelter capacity and accessibility
- Policy implementation and adaptation success

**Composite Indicators to Prioritize:**

- Governance Vulnerability Index components
- Institutional Capacity assessments
- Disaster Preparedness Index data
- Adaptive Governance metrics
- Policy Implementation Effectiveness indices

### Specific Requirements for Climate Vulnerability Assessment

**Essential Governance Indicators:**

- Disaster preparedness and response capacity
- Early warning system coverage and effectiveness
- Climate adaptation planning implementation
- Emergency shelter and evacuation capacity
- Institutional coordination and stakeholder engagement

**Adaptive Capacity Factors:**

- Policy mainstreaming and integration
- Multi-level governance effectiveness
- Stakeholder participation and engagement
- Institutional learning and adaptation
- Resource mobilization and allocation

**Governance Vulnerability Factors:**

- Institutional fragmentation and coordination gaps
- Limited technical and financial capacity
- Weak policy implementation and monitoring
- Insufficient stakeholder engagement processes
- Lack of adaptive governance mechanisms

### Additional Guidance

- Keep each phrase concise (≈ 5-12 words) and avoid identical stems within a category
- Combine location names with governance terminology for geographic specificity
- Include searches for both raw policy documents and processed governance indicators
- Prioritize datasets with institutional resolution for governance vulnerability assessment
- Focus on datasets that can be linked to climate hazard exposure areas
- Include searches for both government and academic governance vulnerability studies
- Target datasets that provide temporal coverage for governance capacity trend analysis
- Look for datasets that include institutional capacity and coordination assessments
- Ensure searches cover both disaster management and climate adaptation governance
