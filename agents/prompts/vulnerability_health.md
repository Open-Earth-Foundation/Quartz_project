### Task

Generate comprehensive search queries to discover health vulnerability datasets that characterize population health status and demographic factors affecting climate sensitivity. Focus on datasets that provide information about age structure, disability rates, chronic disease prevalence, healthcare access, and other health indicators that influence climate vulnerability.

Strict geospatial and resolution constraints:

- Only include geospatial datasets (vector/raster) suitable for GIS
- Require spatial resolution 5 km or finer (≤5 km) for gridded data; vector data should be at administrative/neighborhood or finer scales
- Exclude non-geospatial sources (narrative PDFs, generic tables without geometry or joinable location keys) and datasets coarser than 5 km

For **each** health vulnerability category listed below, produce **targeted search phrases**:

1. **6 phrases in English** (for international and English-language sources)
2. **9 phrases in the primary local language** (if country/city-specific research)

The phrases should target the kinds of queries a health vulnerability researcher would use to find demographic data, health statistics, mortality records, and healthcare accessibility information relevant to climate risk assessment.

### Search Strategy Guidance

**Data Format Priorities:**

- Spatial rasters: GeoTIFF/COG for gridded health-related surfaces (e.g., exposure-risk surfaces)
- Spatial vectors: Shapefile/GeoJSON with health indicators by administrative units
- Statistical tables: CSV/Excel only when joinable to geometry (coordinates or administrative codes)
- Database formats: SQL/feature services for longitudinal health records
- API endpoints: Health ministry and GIS APIs for demographic and health indicators

**Spatial Resolution Targets:**

- Administrative units: Health districts, census tracts, municipalities
- Grid-based: 1 km or finer resolution for population health indicators (reject >5 km)
- Neighborhood level: Sub-municipal health and demographic data
- Household level: Individual and household health survey data

**Temporal Coverage Priorities:**

- Recent census: Most recent population and health census
- Annual surveys: Health and demographic surveys
- Longitudinal data: Time series for disease trends and mortality
- Vital statistics: Birth, death, and disease registration data

**Key Search Terms to Include:**

- Demographics: "age structure", "population aging", "elderly population", "child population"
- Health: "health indicators", "disease prevalence", "mortality rates", "healthcare access"
- Vulnerability: "health vulnerability", "climate-sensitive health", "medical vulnerability"
- Spatial: "health districts", "healthcare facilities", "medical service areas"

**Repository-Specific Searches:**

- Target national health ministries and statistical offices
- Search WHO and international health organization databases
- Look for academic public health data repositories
- Include municipal and local health department data
- Search for NGO and international health assessment data

### Vulnerability Orientation Guidelines

**Higher Values = Greater Vulnerability:**

- Higher rates of chronic diseases and comorbidities
- Lower healthcare access and facility density
- Higher disability and special needs population rates
- Lower health insurance and service coverage
- Higher baseline mortality and morbidity rates

**Lower Values = Greater Vulnerability (Invert for Analysis):**

- Life expectancy and general health status indicators
- Healthcare quality and capacity ratings
- Immunization coverage and preventive care access
- Health system resilience and emergency response capacity

**Composite Indicators to Prioritize:**

- Health Vulnerability Index components
- Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) data
- Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) Index
- Environmental Health Risk Indices
- Climate-Sensitive Health Vulnerability assessments

### Specific Requirements for Climate Vulnerability Assessment

**Essential Health Indicators:**

- Age distribution and demographic vulnerability factors
- Chronic disease prevalence and comorbidity data
- Healthcare access and service availability
- Baseline mortality and morbidity statistics
- Disability and special needs population data

**Demographic Vulnerability Factors:**

- Elderly population concentration (>65 years)
- Young children population (<5 years)
- Gender disparities in health outcomes
- Ethnic and socioeconomic health inequalities
- Rural vs. urban health access differences

**Climate-Sensitive Health Factors:**

- Heat-related health vulnerability
- Air quality and respiratory disease risk
- Vector-borne disease prevalence
- Water-borne disease vulnerability
- Extreme weather health impact potential

### Additional Guidance

- Keep each phrase concise (≈ 5-12 words) and avoid identical stems within a category
- Combine location names with health terminology for geographic specificity
- Include searches for both raw health statistics and processed health indicators
- Prioritize datasets with fine spatial resolution for local health vulnerability assessment
- Focus on datasets that can be linked to climate hazard exposure areas
- Include searches for both government and academic health vulnerability studies
- Target datasets that provide temporal coverage for health trend analysis
- Look for datasets that include climate-sensitive health conditions
- Ensure searches cover both quantitative health indicators and qualitative assessments
