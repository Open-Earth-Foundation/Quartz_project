### Task

Generate comprehensive search queries to discover flood hazard datasets and indicators. Focus on GEOSPATIAL datasets that provide information about flood risks, inundation mapping, and flood-related climate hazards. Prioritize precipitation, water levels, and humidity data in soil and air for comprehensive flood risk assessment and flood modeling.

For **each** flood indicator category listed below, produce **targeted search phrases**:

1. **6 phrases in English** (for international and English-language sources)
2. **9 phrases in the primary local language** (if country/city-specific research)

The phrases should target the kinds of queries a hydrologist or flood modeler would use to find flood hazard data, inundation maps, and flood risk indicators.

### Search Strategy Guidance

**Data Format Priorities (Geospatial Focus):**

- NetCDF files for gridded precipitation and flood model outputs
- GeoTIFF for flood inundation maps and depth grids
- Shapefile format for flood boundaries and river networks
- GRIB format for meteorological model outputs
- Zarr format for cloud-optimized geospatial data
- API endpoints for real-time flood monitoring data

**Temporal Coverage Priorities:**

- Historical flood events (last 50+ years)
- Recent observations and monitoring (2010-present)
- Future projections: 2030s, 2050s, 2080s
- High-frequency data (hourly, daily) for flood modeling
- Multi-temporal datasets for trend analysis

**Spatial Resolution Targets:**

- Global: 0.05° to 0.25° grid spacing for global flood monitoring
- Regional: 1-10 km resolution for flood forecasting
- National: ≤1km for flood risk mapping
- Local: ≤100m for detailed flood modeling and urban areas

**Key Search Terms to Include:**

- Technical: "flood", "inundation", "floodplain", "river discharge", "flood frequency"
- Indices: "flood risk", "flood vulnerability", "flood hazard", "return period", "IDF curves"
- Data formats: "flood map", "inundation grid", "discharge data", "water level"
- Climate: "extreme precipitation", "storm events", "climate change floods"
- Applications: "flood modeling", "flood forecasting", "flood risk assessment"

**Repository-Specific Searches:**

- Include searches targeting hydrological service databases
