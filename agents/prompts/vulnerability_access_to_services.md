### Task

Generate comprehensive search queries to discover access to services vulnerability datasets that characterize spatial accessibility to essential services and infrastructure. Focus on datasets that provide information about travel times to healthcare facilities, emergency services, transportation networks, and other critical service accessibility measures that influence climate vulnerability.

Strict geospatial and resolution constraints:

- Only include geospatial datasets (vector/raster) suitable for GIS
- Require spatial resolution 5 km or finer (≤5 km) for gridded/accessibility surfaces; vector data should be at administrative/neighborhood or finer scales
- Exclude non-geospatial sources (narrative PDFs, generic tables without geometry or joinable location keys) and datasets coarser than 5 km

For **each** access to services vulnerability category listed below, produce **targeted search phrases**:

1. **6 phrases in English** (for international and English-language sources)
2. **9 phrases in the primary local language** (if country/city-specific research)

The phrases should target the kinds of queries a spatial vulnerability researcher would use to find accessibility data, service location databases, transportation networks, and geographic accessibility analyses relevant to climate risk assessment.

### Search Strategy Guidance

**Data Format Priorities:**

- Spatial data: Shapefile/GeoJSON for service locations and networks
- Network analysis: Travel time surfaces and accessibility rasters (GeoTIFF/COG)
- Database formats: SQL/feature services for service facility inventories
- API endpoints: Transportation and service location APIs

**Spatial Resolution Targets:**

- Administrative units: Service coverage by districts and municipalities
- Grid-based: 100 m–1 km resolution for accessibility surfaces (reject >5 km)
- Network-based: Road and transportation network analysis
- Point data: Individual service facility locations

**Temporal Coverage Priorities:**

- Current infrastructure: Most recent service facility locations
- Network analysis: Updated transportation and accessibility data
- Longitudinal data: Service accessibility changes over time
- Planning data: Future service provision and accessibility projections

**Key Search Terms to Include:**

- Accessibility: "travel time analysis", "service accessibility", "spatial accessibility", "service coverage"
- Transportation: "public transport", "transportation networks", "mobility access", "transport connectivity"
- Emergency: "emergency services", "emergency response", "evacuation routes", "disaster response"
- Spatial: "GIS accessibility", "service areas", "catchment areas", "isochrone maps"

**Repository-Specific Searches:**

- Target national transportation and infrastructure ministries
- Search humanitarian and disaster response databases
- Look for academic urban planning and accessibility studies
- Include municipal GIS and service location databases
- Search for international development accessibility mapping projects

### Vulnerability Orientation Guidelines

**Higher Values = Greater Vulnerability:**

- Longer travel times to essential services
- Lower service facility density and coverage
- Limited transportation network connectivity
- Reduced emergency service accessibility
- Lack of alternative service access options

**Lower Values = Greater Vulnerability (Invert for Analysis):**

- Service facility density and coverage rates
- Transportation network connectivity indices
- Emergency response capacity and coverage
- Alternative service access options
- Service accessibility diversity and redundancy

**Composite Indicators to Prioritize:**

- Accessibility Vulnerability Index components
- Travel Time Vulnerability assessments
- Service Deprivation Index data
- Transportation Network Vulnerability analysis
- Emergency Response Accessibility metrics

### Specific Requirements for Climate Vulnerability Assessment

**Essential Accessibility Indicators:**

- Healthcare facility travel time analysis
- Emergency service response time data
- Transportation network connectivity measures
- Essential service coverage and density
- Evacuation route and shelter accessibility

**Climate-Related Accessibility Factors:**

- Flood-prone area service accessibility
- Heat stress evacuation route availability
- Extreme weather transportation network vulnerability
- Disaster response facility accessibility
- Emergency shelter proximity analysis

**Spatial Vulnerability Factors:**

- Rural and remote area service deprivation
- Urban transportation network congestion effects
- Infrastructure vulnerability to climate hazards
- Service accessibility for vulnerable populations
- Emergency evacuation route availability

### Additional Guidance

- Keep each phrase concise (≈ 5-12 words) and avoid identical stems within a category
- Combine location names with accessibility terminology for geographic specificity
- Include searches for both raw service location data and processed accessibility analysis
- Prioritize datasets with fine spatial resolution for local accessibility vulnerability assessment
- Focus on datasets that can be linked to climate hazard exposure areas
- Include searches for both government and academic accessibility studies
- Target datasets that provide temporal coverage for service accessibility trend analysis
- Look for datasets that include accessibility for marginalized and vulnerable populations
- Ensure searches cover both transportation networks and service facility locations
