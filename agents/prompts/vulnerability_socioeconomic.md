### Task

Generate comprehensive search queries to discover socioeconomic vulnerability datasets that characterize population susceptibility and adaptive capacity to climate hazards. Focus on datasets that provide information about income, education, employment, housing, and social conditions that influence climate vulnerability.

For **each** socioeconomic vulnerability category listed below, produce **targeted search phrases**:

1. **6 phrases in English** (for international and English-language sources)
2. **9 phrases in the primary local language** (if country/city-specific research)

The phrases should target the kinds of queries a vulnerability researcher would use to find census data, social indicators, poverty statistics, and demographic information relevant to climate risk assessment.

### Search Strategy Guidance

**Data Format Priorities:**

- Statistical tables: CSV, Excel, SPSS for survey and census data
- Spatial data: Shapefiles with socioeconomic attributes by administrative units
- Database formats: SQL databases for longitudinal social data
- API endpoints: Statistical office APIs for demographic indicators

**Spatial Resolution Targets:**

- Administrative units: Census tracts, districts, municipalities
- Grid-based: 1km or finer resolution for population-weighted indicators
- Neighborhood level: Sub-municipal social and economic data
- Household level: Individual and household survey data

**Temporal Coverage Priorities:**

- Recent census: Most recent national census (typically every 10 years)
- Annual surveys: Labor force, income, and living condition surveys
- Longitudinal data: Time series for trend analysis
- Projection data: Population and socioeconomic projections

**Key Search Terms to Include:**

- Demographics: "population demographics", "census data", "household surveys"
- Economic: "income distribution", "poverty rates", "employment statistics"
- Social: "social indicators", "living conditions", "community characteristics"
- Vulnerability: "social vulnerability", "adaptive capacity", "resilience indicators"
- Spatial: "neighborhood data", "census tracts", "administrative units"

**Repository-Specific Searches:**

- Target national statistical offices and census bureaus
- Search international development organization databases
- Look for academic social science data repositories
- Include municipal and local government social data
- Search for NGO and civil society social assessments

### Vulnerability Orientation Guidelines

**Higher Values = Greater Vulnerability:**

- Poverty rates, unemployment rates, income inequality
- Housing overcrowding, informal settlement populations
- Educational gaps, language barriers, digital divides
- Social isolation, lack of community networks

**Lower Values = Greater Vulnerability (Invert for Analysis):**

- Income levels, educational attainment, employment rates
- Housing quality, homeownership rates, utility access
- Social capital, community participation, institutional trust

**Composite Indicators to Prioritize:**

- Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) components
- Human Development Index (HDI) sub-components
- Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) dimensions
- Community resilience and adaptive capacity indices

### Specific Requirements for Climate Vulnerability Assessment

**Essential Socioeconomic Indicators:**

- Income distribution and poverty measures
- Educational attainment and literacy rates
- Employment status and job security
- Housing tenure and quality indicators
- Access to basic services and infrastructure

**Demographic Vulnerability Factors:**

- Age structure (elderly and children populations)
- Gender and household head characteristics
- Disability status and special needs populations
- Ethnic and linguistic minority status
- Recent migration and displacement history

**Adaptive Capacity Indicators:**

- Financial resources and savings
- Insurance coverage and risk management
- Social networks and community support
- Access to information and early warning systems
- Institutional trust and governance quality

### Additional Guidance

- Keep each phrase concise (≈ 5-12 words) and avoid identical stems within a category
- Combine location names with socioeconomic terminology for geographic specificity
- Include searches for both raw census data and processed social indicators
- Prioritize datasets with fine spatial resolution for local vulnerability assessment
- Focus on datasets that can be linked to climate hazard exposure areas
- Include searches for both government and academic social vulnerability studies
- Target datasets that provide temporal coverage for trend analysis
- Look for datasets that include marginalized and vulnerable population groups
- Ensure searches cover both quantitative indicators and qualitative assessments
