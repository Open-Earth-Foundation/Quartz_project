### Task

Generate comprehensive search queries to discover drought hazard datasets and indicators. Focus on GEOSPATIAL datasets that provide information about precipitation deficits, water scarcity, soil moisture conditions, and drought-related climate hazards. Prioritize precipitation, water levels, and humidity data in soil and air for comprehensive drought risk assessment.

For **each** drought indicator category listed below, produce **targeted search phrases**:

1. **6 phrases in English** (for international and English-language sources)
2. **9 phrases in the primary local language** (if country/city-specific research)

The phrases should target the kinds of queries a climate researcher would use to find drought hazard data, water balance indicators, and soil moisture conditions.

### Search Strategy Guidance

**Data Format Priorities (Geospatial Focus):**

- NetCDF files for gridded precipitation and soil moisture data
- GeoTIFF/COG for processed drought indicators and indices
- GRIB format for meteorological model outputs
- Zarr format for cloud-optimized geospatial data
- Shapefile/GeoJSON for drought monitoring boundaries
- API endpoints for real-time drought monitoring data

**Temporal Coverage Priorities:**

- Historical baselines: 1981-2010, 1991-2020
- Recent observations: 2010-present
- Future projections: 2030s, 2050s, 2080s
- Monthly resolution preferred for drought analysis
- Multi-temporal datasets for trend analysis

**Spatial Resolution Targets (enforce ≤5 km for gridded data):**

- Global: ≈0.05° (~5 km at equator) or finer grid spacing
- Regional: ≤5 km resolution for detailed drought monitoring
- National: ≤5 km for country-level drought assessment
- Local: ≤1 km for agricultural and urban drought analysis

**Key Search Terms to Include:**

- Technical: "drought", "precipitation deficit", "soil moisture", "water balance", "aridity"
- Indices: "SPI", "SPEI", "PDSI", "CMI", "evapotranspiration", "PET", "AET"
- Data formats: "gridded precipitation", "soil moisture data", "drought indices"
- Climate: "drought projections", "climate change drought", "drought vulnerability"
- Applications: "agricultural drought", "meteorological drought", "hydrological drought"

**Repository-Specific Searches:**

- Include searches targeting specific data portals (e.g., "ESA CCI soil moisture drought")
- Target national drought monitoring centers and early warning systems
- Search for FAO and WMO drought-related datasets
- Look for climate risk assessment reports with drought components
- Target remote sensing datasets for drought monitoring

### Additional Guidance

- Keep each phrase concise (≈ 5-12 words) and avoid identical stems within a category
- Combine location names with technical terms for geographic specificity
- Include both observational data and climate projection searches for drought
- Prioritize datasets with clear temporal coverage and spatial resolution
- Focus on datasets suitable for drought risk assessment and water resource management
- Include searches for both raw meteorological data and processed drought indices
- Target both academic/research sources and operational drought monitoring systems
- Emphasize geospatial data formats suitable for GIS and spatial analysis
- Include searches for real-time drought monitoring and early warning systems
