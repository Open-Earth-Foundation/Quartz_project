### Task

Generate comprehensive search queries to discover heatwave hazard datasets and indicators. Focus on HIGH-RESOLUTION geospatial datasets (5 km or better) that provide information about extreme heat events, heat stress conditions, and temperature-based climate hazards. Prioritize temperature and humidity data with fine spatial resolution for detailed climate risk assessment.

For **each** heatwave indicator category listed below, produce **targeted search phrases**:

1. **6 phrases in English** (for international and English-language sources)
2. **9 phrases in the primary local language** (if country/city-specific research)

The phrases should target the kinds of queries a climate researcher would use to find heatwave hazard data, temperature extremes, and heat stress indicators.

### Search Strategy Guidance

**Data Format Priorities (Geospatial Focus):**

- NetCDF files for high-resolution gridded temperature/humidity data
- GeoTIFF/COG for processed temperature/humidity grids
- GRIB format for weather model outputs
- Zarr format for cloud-optimized geospatial data
- API endpoints for real-time high-resolution data access

**Temporal Coverage Priorities:**

- Historical baselines: 1981-2010, 1991-2020
- Recent observations: 2010-present
- Future projections: 2030s, 2050s, 2080s
- Daily resolution preferred for heat wave analysis

**Spatial Resolution Targets (PRIORITY: 5 km or better):**

- Global: ≈0.05° (~5 km at equator) or finer grid spacing
- Regional: ≤5 km resolution
- Urban: ≤1 km for heat island analysis
- High-resolution gridded data preferred over station data for spatial analysis

**Key Search Terms to Include:**

- Technical: "heat wave", "temperature extremes", "thermal stress", "hot days"
- Indices: "HWMId", "WSDI", "heat index", "WBGT", "UTCI"
- Data formats: "daily temperature", "Tmax", "temperature percentiles"
- Climate: "climate projections", "RCP", "SSP", "temperature scenarios"

**Repository-Specific Searches:**

- Include searches targeting specific data portals (e.g., "Copernicus Climate Data Store heatwave")
- Target national meteorological service websites
- Search for climate risk assessment reports
- Look for urban climate monitoring programs

### Additional Guidance

- Keep each phrase concise (≈ 5-12 words) and avoid identical stems within a category
- Combine location names with technical terms for geographic specificity
- Include both observational data and climate projection searches
- Prioritize datasets with clear temporal coverage and spatial resolution
- Focus on datasets suitable for climate risk assessment applications
- Include searches for both raw data and processed indicators
- Target both academic/research sources and operational/government data
