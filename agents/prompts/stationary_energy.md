# Stationary Energy Sector - CCRA Emissions Analysis

## Overview

Stationary energy refers to energy production and consumption from fixed installations such as power plants, industrial facilities, and buildings. This sector is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, particularly CO2 from fossil fuel combustion.

## Key Emissions Sources

- **Electricity Generation**: Coal, natural gas, and oil-fired power plants
- **Industrial Processes**: Manufacturing, chemical production, and heavy industry
- **Commercial and Residential Buildings**: Heating, cooling, and lighting systems
- **District Heating Systems**: Centralized heat production and distribution

## Primary Greenhouse Gases

- **CO2 (Carbon Dioxide)**: Main GHG from fossil fuel combustion
- **CH4 (Methane)**: From natural gas leakage and incomplete combustion
- **N2O (Nitrous Oxide)**: From high-temperature combustion processes

## Data Categories and Indicators

### Activity Data

- **Fuel Consumption**: By type (coal, oil, natural gas, biomass, etc.)
- **Energy Production**: Electricity and heat generation by source
- **Building Stock**: Floor area, energy use intensity, heating systems
- **Industrial Output**: Production levels by sector and subsector

### Emissions Factors

- **Fuel-Specific Emission Factors**: CO2, CH4, N2O per unit of fuel
- **Technology-Specific Factors**: By combustion technology and efficiency
- **Regional Variations**: Country/region-specific emission factors

### Mitigation Measures

- **Energy Efficiency**: Building retrofits, industrial process improvements
- **Fuel Switching**: From coal to gas, gas to renewables
